        "We can define Hugging Face as a technology company dedicated to the development of tools and platforms for natural language processing (NLP) based on artificial intelligence. Their focus is on creating state-of-the-art deep learning models for tasks such as natural language understanding, natural language generation, sentiment analysis, or machine translation, among others.\n",

        "Additionally, Hugging Face has created an open-source platform called Transformers, which allows developers worldwide to access and use state-of-the-art pre-trained NLP models. This Hugging Face platform has become a fundamental tool for the development of NLP-based applications and has been embraced by a wide community of developers and companies.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, when talking about what Hugging Face is, it's important to highlight that it is a company leading the artificial intelligence revolution in natural language processing. Moreover, it is making it more accessible and easier for developers and companies worldwide to leverage the latest NLP technologies."

It uses attention mechanisms to identify relevant parts of the question and the dataset. Subsequently, the transformer generates a response that is pertinent to the question.\n",
